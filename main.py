1.4 Project management standards
 
 Projects require effective management from inception to completion if they are to be completed
 safely, on time and within budget and to meet additional business objectives as well. Therefore,
 project management is nothing more than the controlled execution of an activity to complete an
 agreed scope of work and meet predefined targets. The main objective of project management
 is to deliver all the project goals and targets for the customer and possibly other stakeholders
 involved within the boundary conditions given. Consequently, the management of engineering
 projects is the controlled execution of design, engineering and construction activities for an
 engineering project in such a manner that the project can be realised to meet the requirements
 of the customer, technical or otherwise, within the given constraints such as safety, cost, time,
 quality, resource, etc.
 
 Project management is all about structure, standards and processes. Since the birth of the pro
ject management discipline at the end of the 1950s, the various project management bodies
 have grown exponentially. They all have produced best practices, guides and supporting tools
 to further develop the project management discipline. At the moment a variety of standards and
 disciplines are available for managing projects. Probably the oldest and best established is the
 Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK, 2008). The PMBoK Guide as developed, main
tained and published by PMI (Project Management Institute) is the preeminent global standard
 for project management. It provides project managers with the fundamental practices needed to
 achieve organisational results and excellence in the practice of project management.
 Their counterpart, the International Project Management Association (IPMA) has developed the
 International Competence Baseline (ICB) Version 3.0. The ICB provides the official definition of
 the competences expected from project management personnel by IPMA for certification within
 the IPMA certification system.
 
 Some governments developed over the years their own project management systems. The best
known example is PRINCE2. PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments, 2009) is a de facto
 standard developed and used extensively by the UK government and is widely recognised and
 applied in the private sector, both in the UK and internationally. It embodies established and
 proven best practice in project management.
 
 Since mid-2012 the voluntary International Standard Organisation (ISO) has issued the ISO 21500
 Guidance on Project Management. The latter has been developed by participants from over 30
 countries. It can be used by any type of organisation including public, private or community
 organisations, and for any type of project irrespective of complexity, size and duration. ISO 21500
 provides a high-level description of concepts and processes that are considered to form good
 practice in project management. New project managers as well as experienced managers will be
 able to use the project management guidance in this standard to improve project success and
 achieve business results.
 
 Not only governments developed their own project management systems and procedures but
 also, large industrial companies decided to translate their own successful working practices in
 the field of project management into a project management system. Those pragmatic and prac
tice-oriented systems for managing projects form the basis of the approach chosen in this book.
