The fourth and present era (1994 onwards) shows an unprecedented availability of and accessibility to \
information. With the advent of the Internet and its spread across the globe, the project management \
community has become more efficient in controlling and managing the various aspects of projects.
 
The first time that the general public in its entirety was confronted with project management and its \
side effects was around the transition into the new millennium, also known as the Y2K project or the \
Millennium Bug. The Y2K project was instigated by the belief that on January 1st, 2000, most computer \
programmes would not function correctly anymore. Many organisations  adopted project management tools \
and techniques to execute their own Y2K project.
 
In this same period, the oil and gas industry started developing even larger major capital investment \
projects in order to keep up with the ever growing energy demand of the world. Easy oil has long been \
discovered and the explorations and developments must now take place in new and unknown territories. \
Projects are becoming more complex with even bigger technological challenges. Examples include deep-water \
exploration and production near Brazil, in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia (~ 3 km of water depth), \
ever larger Liquid Natural Gas plants in the Middle East and the far east of Russia (liquefying \
natural gas at low temperature and transporting it by ship) and the Gas to Liquid plants in South Africa \
and in Qatar (making liquid products out of gas via the Fischer-Tropsch process). 1.3 From ‘over the fence’ \
management to project management Over-the-fence management (Kerzner, 2005) preceded contemporary project management. \
Traditionally, each discipline or function took care of its own activities. When the task was completed, \
the job was given to the next function in the line (‘thrown over the fence’). This means  \
that all the work was completely sequentially in nature and the last in line would most probably get \
all the blame if the project went off-track. As a consequence schedule improvement was hard to realise. \
The majority of project activities were performed by line managers who were more interested in the advancement \
of their own departments than the success of the task at hand. In fact, nobody was truly looking after \
the best interest of the project. Project management did not really exist. Another disadvantage of this \
sequential approach was that it was very difficult for customers to keep track of where their ‘project’ was. \
Therefore at a certain stage, customers (and looking at
 the earlier examples this was most often the government) demanded a single point of contact throughout the \
 ‘project’, a person who would be part of the development process during the  entire lifecycle. When this \
 happened in the 1950s, the project manager was born. Initially, this came with much resistance from senior \
 managers as well as sales and marketing staff, since all  were afraid of losing their influence. From there \
 on the whole project management approach has been mostly based on best practice sharing and handing over of \
 experience from manager to manager. This system has quite  a number of similarities with the traditional \
 medieval master/fellow relation, although project management is a much younger discipline.
